Tests
=====

You can run tests by doing::

    ./setup.py test
    
This will install necessary dependencies as well. In ``tests`` subdirectory there is a testing Django project with tests. You can check it to for usage examples, as well.

To test different versions at the same time, `Travis CI`_ is used.
